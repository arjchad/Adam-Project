## Code scaffolding


Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:


```bash

ng generate component component-name

```


For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:


```bash

ng generate --help

```

You must cd into the root directory where your angular workspace is located. For me it is:

```
cd /Users/ajchadha/IdeaProjects/src/AdamProjectTest/Adam-Project
```

Run to download all necessary packages
```
npm install
```

Then run to build your project
```
ng build
```

And now deploy on localhost
```
ng serve
```
