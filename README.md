1. **Frontend**: Built with Angular, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
2. **Backend Integration**: Communicates with RESTful APIs to handle data operations.
3. **Authentication**: Secure login and role-based access control.
4. **State Management**: Utilizes NgRx for efficient state handling (optional).
5. **Styling**: Leveraging CSS and Angular Material for consistent and modern design.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **Angular CLI** (v14.2.0 or later)
- **Git**

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-training-portal-frontend.git
    cd employee-training-portal-frontend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, install the necessary packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

    Create a `environment.ts` file in the `src/environments/` directory and add your configuration settings:

    ```typescript
    export const environment = {
      production: false,
      API_BASE_URL: 'https://api.yourdomain.com'
    };
    ```

## Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Configuration

Configure the application by modifying the `environment.ts` file located in the `src/environments/` directory.

```typescript
// src/environments/environment.ts

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  API_BASE_URL: 'https://api.yourdomain.com'
};
```

## Running the Application

To build and serve the application locally with automatic reload on code changes, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files. It will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Usage

- **Administrators** can manage training modules, assign courses to employees, and monitor progress through interactive dashboards.
- **Employees** can access assigned training modules, track their learning progress, and utilize the resource library for additional information.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: Angular
- **Styling**: CSS, Angular Material
- **Routing**: Angular Router
- **State Management**: NgRx (optional)
- **Backend Integration**: RESTful APIs (compatible with any backend technology)
- **Testing**: Jasmine, Karma
- **Package Management**: npm
